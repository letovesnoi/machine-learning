## Project: PNPs spectra classification

The problem of this Capstone project is to **categorize PNPs spectra** into spectra corresponding to **cyclic** and **linear** compounds. Thus the program requires spectrum of the unknown compound as input and defines type of the compound structure as output.

**Python 3** with **pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn** and mainly **Keras** is used. Also [Natural Product Discovery tools](https://github.com/ablab/npdtools) and [Marvin](https://chemaxon.com/products/marvin) are required. Implementation is in the ```capstone.ipynb```.
